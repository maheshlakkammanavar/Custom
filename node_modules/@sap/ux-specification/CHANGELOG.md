### Removed

- Properties disableInlineCreateSort and selectionLimit were removed from the global table settings of OData V2, as they are not supported yet by the run-time.

### Fixed

- V4. Schema generation for object page. Section label is not resolved within target definition and id was presented in "description"

## [1.108.29] - 2024-05-02

### Changed

- In a previous version, the tag `descriptionSrcUrl` (link to the UI5 documentation) was added in form of a JSDoc annotation. It became evident that this annotation was not transferred correctly in all cases to the JSON schema by the to-json-schema generator.
To overcome this problem, `descriptionSrcUrl` is now placed in form of reflect metadata at all sync classes, and added to the schema by an own post-processing routine `processMetadata` that evaluates the reflect metadata.

### Removed

- Property createMode was removed from the global table settings of OData V2, as it is not supported yet by the run-time.

### Deprecated

### Fixed

OData V4:

- view properties like custom columns or table settings had not been exported, as the anyOf definition of additionalProperties had not been considered during the export.
- sync rule was missing for ViewToolBarAction.afterExecution
- partially an invalid annotationPath was added for views, comprising '@@'
- toolbar actions had partially not been considered during the import
- the export of table properties had overwritten the export from views
- the export now supports two different constellations for anyOf definitions in schema:
  - anyOf directly defined as additionalProperties (of MultiTableMode)
  - anyOf reachable via $ref, properties defined there.
- Custom section fragments with event handler. `core:require` attribute is moved from `Button` to wrapper `VBox`
- Default 'empty' `manifest.json` is returned after export of FPM Custom Page
- The generation of config files failed with exception if a custom header action was defined with an invalid type, like string.
- empty `sap.ui5/routing/config` object removed from `manifest.json` during export

OData V2:  

- The logic that determines the LineItem and the Chart annotation to be used by ALP was not in sync with the logic implemented in Fiori Elements v2. The logic has been adapted accordingly.

### Quality

- Code comments added in types package that explain the interfaces and refer to their implementation classes

## [1.108.28] - 2024-04-17

### Added

### Changed

- OData V2:
  - Fragment templates for custom column extensions for AnalyticalTable, GridTable, TreeTable, ResponsiveTable

## [1.108.25] - 2024-03-07

### Added

The additional parameter entityPath must be applied. The new functions are released for List Report, Object Page and Analytical List Page of OData V2 and V4.
- In the API result a change indicator is added that shows if the manifest was changed.

  - 
  
### Changed

- Alignment of settings for sap.ovp:  
The global settings and card specific settings have been compared with the actual status of the documentation and the subschema as available at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/manifest>. Missing settings have been added, obsolete settings have been eliminated.
The assignment of settings to the specific card types has been revised and adjusted.

### Quality

- Update transitive dependencies

Upgrades

## [1.108.20] - 2023-11-30

### Added

- OData V2: Added missing `annotationPath` property for table definitions in schema was added

### Changed

- OVP card settings:
  - Added missing properties
  - Removed irrelevant settings from custom card settings
  - Assignment of settings to card types has been generally aligned with the given capabilities of SAP Fiori elements

- If problems had been posted to the log with regards to annotations, they normally ended with the information `location: webapp/localService/metadata.xml`. This location information might be misleading for edmx projects, as annotation may reside in a different file. It was always wrong for CAP projects.
Thus the location information is removed for annotation problems

- If no line item annotation is present, no `annotationPath` property gets added to the schemas of OData V2 and V4

### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- The check of minUI5Version against the dist tags raised wrong warnings in case of minUI5Version using the pattern 'UI5-xxx'

### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - If multiple facets refer to target annotations without an ID but with identical labels, only one of the facets was shown in the page editor
  - An error message was added to the logger if the ID was missing for a reference facet. This was wrong, the ID is optional for reference facets. Instead, the error message is now added for missing IDs of collection facets

## [1.108.8] - 2023-06-14

### Added

- OData V4:
  - Support for Custom subsections.

### Changed

- OData V4:
  - Changed binding expression to use "isEditable" property instead of "editable". Thus we have binding expressions {ui>/isEditable} and {= !${ui>/isEditable}}.

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - When adding new pages, the export calculates the route pattern for the new manifest entry.
  Indeed, the previous logic did not consider the naming at parent pages, but defined the key name in the pattern as `key`(+ index). This led to navigation errors at run-time. Now, the key names of existing parent pages are taken over to the child page's pattern.
